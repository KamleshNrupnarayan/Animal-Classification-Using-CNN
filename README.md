# Animal Classification Using CNN

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify animals as **Wild** or **Pet** from image inputs. With advancements in deep learning, CNNs have become essential for image classification tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features. This project provides a foundation for various applications, including pet identification, wildlife monitoring, and security.
